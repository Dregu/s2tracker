Or just [get the release](https://github.com/Dregu/s2tracker/releases/latest) with nodejs packaged in.

## Usage
Start s2tracker, enable the tracker option in the [autosplitter](https://github.com/Dregu/LiveSplit-Spelunky2) and go to http://localhost:27122/.

Go to http://localhost:27122/#area to arrange everything by their probable area found.

Click on the category names or just go to http://localhost:27122/#people to show just one category.

Click on the icons to hide them manually, if you're not using livesplit for some reason.
